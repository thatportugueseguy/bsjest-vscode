Uh oh, something went wrong? Use this guide to resolve issues with Jest.

### Tests are Failing and You Don't Know Why

Try using the debugging support built into Node. Note: This will only work in
Node.js 8+.

Place a `debugger;` statement in any of your tests, and then, in your project's
directory, run:

```bash
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand [any other arguments here]
or on Windows
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --runInBand [any other arguments here]
```

This will run Jest in a Node process that an external debugger can connect to.
Note that the process will pause until the debugger has connected to it.

To debug in Google Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser), simply open your
browser and go to `chrome://inspect` and click on "Open Dedicated DevTools for
Node", which will give you a list of available node instances you can connect
to. Simply click on the address displayed in the terminal (usually something
like `localhost:9229`) after running the above command, and you will be able to
debug Jest using Chrome's DevTools.

The Chrome Developer Tools will be displayed, and a breakpoint will be set at
the first line of the Jest CLI script (this is done simply to give you time to
open the developer tools and to prevent Jest from executing before you have time
to do so). Click the button that looks like a "play" button in the upper right
hand side of the screen to continue execution. When Jest executes the test that
contains the `debugger` statement, execution will pause and you can examine the
current scope and call stack.

> Note: the `--runInBand` cli option makes sure Jest runs test in the same
> process rather than spawning processes for individual tests. Normally Jest
> parallelizes test runs across processes but it is hard to debug many processes
> at the same time.

### Debugging in VS Code

There are multiple ways to debug Jest tests with
[Visual Studio Code's](https://code.visualstudio.com) built in
[debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging).

To attach the built-in debugger, run your tests as aforementioned:

```bash
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand [any other arguments here]
or on Windows
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --runInBand [any other arguments here]
```

Then attach VS Code's debugger using the following `launch.json` config:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "name": "Attach",
      "port": 9229
    }
  ]
}
```

To automatically launch and attach to a process running your tests, use the
following configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Jest Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "--inspect-brk",
        "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/jest",
        "--runInBand"
      ],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
    }
  ]
}
```

or the following for Windows:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Jest Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "--inspect-brk",
        "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js",
        "--runInBand"
      ],
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you are using Facebook's
[`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), you
can debug your Jest tests with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug CRA Tests",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/react-scripts",
      "args": ["test", "--runInBand", "--no-cache", "--env=jsdom"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}",
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
    }
  ]
}
```

More information on Node debugging can be found
[here](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html).

### Debugging in WebStorm

The easiest way to debug Jest tests in
[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is using
`Jest run/debug configuration`. It will launch tests and automatically attach
debugger.

In the WebStorm menu `Run` select `Edit Configurations...`. Then click `+` and
select `Jest`. Optionally specify the Jest configuration file, additional
options, and environment variables. Save the configuration, put the breakpoints
in the code, then click the green debug icon to start debugging.

If you are using Facebook's
[`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), in
the Jest run/debug configuration specify the path to the `react-scripts` package
in the Jest package field and add `--env=jsdom` to the Jest options field.

### Caching Issues

The transform script was changed or babel was updated and the changes aren't
being recognized by Jest?

Retry with [`--no-cache`](CLI.md#cache). Jest caches transformed module files to
speed up test execution. If you are using your own custom transformer, consider
adding a `getCacheKey` function to it:
[getCacheKey in Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay/blob/58cf36c73769690f0bbf90562707eadb062b029d/scripts/jest/preprocessor.js#L56-L61).

### Unresolved Promises

If a promise doesn't resolve at all, this error might be thrown:

```bash
- Error: Timeout - Async callback was not invoked within timeout specified by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL.`
```

Most commonly this is being caused by conflicting Promise implementations.
Consider replacing the global promise implementation with your own, for example
`global.Promise = require.requireActual('promise');` and/or consolidate the used
Promise libraries to a single one.

If your test is long running, you may want to consider to increase the timeout
by calling `jest.setTimeout`

```js
jest.setTimeout(10000); // 10 second timeout
```

### Watchman Issues

Try running Jest with [`--no-watchman`](CLI.md#watchman) or set the `watchman`
configuration option to `false`.

[watchman troubleshooting](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/troubleshooting.html).

### Tests are Extremely Slow on Docker and/or Continuous Integration (CI) server.

While Jest is most of the time extremely fast on modern multi-core computers
with fast SSDs, it may be slow on certain setups as our users
[have](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1395)
[discovered](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1524#issuecomment-260246008).

Based on the
[findings](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/1524#issuecomment-262366820),
one way to mitigate this issue and improve the speed by up to 50% is to run
tests sequentially.

In order to do this you can run tests in the same thread using
[`--runInBand`](CLI.md#runinband):

```bash
# Using Jest CLI
jest --runInBand

# Using yarn test (e.g. with create-react-app)
yarn test --runInBand
```

Another alternative to expediting test execution time on Continuous Integration
Servers such as Travis-CI is to set the max worker pool to ~_4_. Specifically on
Travis-CI, this can reduce test execution time in half. Note: The Travis CI
_free_ plan available for open source projects only includes 2 CPU cores.

```bash
# Using Jest CLI
jest --maxWorkers=4

# Using yarn test (e.g. with create-react-app)
yarn test --maxWorkers=4
```

### Compatibility issues

Jest takes advantage of new features added to Node 6. We recommend that you
upgrade to the latest stable release of Node. The minimum supported version is
`v6.0.0`. Versions `0.x.x` and `4.x.x` are not supported because the `jsdom`
version used in Jest doesn't support Node 4. However, if you need to run Jest on
Node 4, you can use the `testEnvironment` config to use a
[custom environment](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#testenvironment-string)
that supports Node 4, such as
[`jest-environment-node`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest-environment-node).

### `coveragePathIgnorePatterns` seems to not have any effect.

Make sure you are not using the `babel-plugin-istanbul` plugin. Jest wraps
Istanbul, and therefore also tells Istanbul what files to instrument with
coverage collection. When using `babel-plugin-istanbul`, every file that is
processed by Babel will have coverage collection code, hence it is not being
ignored by `coveragePathIgnorePatterns`.

### Still unresolved?
