# How to Contribute

Jest is one of Facebook's open source projects that is both under very active
development and is also being used to ship code to everybody on
[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com). We're still working out the kinks to
make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, but we're
not quite there yet. Hopefully this document makes the process for contributing
clear and answers some questions that you may have.

## [Code of Conduct](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct)

Facebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to
adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct)
so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Open Development

All work on Jest happens directly on [GitHub](/). Both core team members and
external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review
process.

### `master` is unsafe

We will do our best to keep `master` in good shape, with tests passing at all
times. But in order to move fast, we will make API changes that your application
might not be compatible with. We will do our best to communicate these changes
and always version appropriately so you can lock into a specific version if need
be.

### Workflow and Pull Requests

The core team will be monitoring for pull requests. When we get one, we'll run
some Facebook-specific integration tests on it first. From here, we'll need to
get another person to sign off on the changes and then merge the pull request.
For API changes we may need to fix internal uses, which could cause some delay.
We'll do our best to provide updates and feedback throughout the process.

_Before_ submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is doneâ€¦

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. A guide on how to fork a
    repository: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

    Open terminal (e.g. Terminal, iTerm, Git Bash or Git Shell) and type:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/jest
    cd jest
    git checkout -b my_branch
    ```

    Note: Replace `<your_username>` with your GitHub username

2.  Jest uses [Yarn](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1840075619545360) for
    running development scripts. If you haven't already done so, please
    [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

3.  Run `yarn install`. On Windows: To install
    [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-tab) on Windows you may
    need to download either node.js or Chocolatey<br />

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

    To check your version of Yarn and ensure it's installed you can type:

    ```sh
    yarn --version
    ```

4.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. You can use watch
    mode that continuously transforms changed files to make your life easier.

    ```sh
    # in the background
    yarn run watch
    ```

5.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.

6.  Ensure the test suite passes via `yarn test`. To run the test suite you may
    need to install [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) (`hg`). On
    macOS, this can be done using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
    `brew install hg`.

    ```sh
    brew install hg # maybe
    yarn test
    ```

7.  If you haven't already, complete the CLA.

#### Additional Workflow for any changes made to website or docs

If you are making changes to the website or documentation, test the website
folder and run the server to check if your changes are being displayed
accurately.

1.  Locate to the website directory and install any website specific
    dependencies by typing in `yarn`. Following steps are to be followed for
    this purpose from the root directory.
    ```sh
    cd website       # Only needed if you are not already in the website directory
    yarn
    yarn start
    ```
2.  You can run a development server to check if the changes you made are being
    displayed accurately by running `yarn start` in the website directory.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need
to do this once, so if you've done this for another Facebook open source
project, you're good to go. If you are submitting a pull request for the first
time, just let us know that you have completed the CLA and we can cross-check
with your GitHub username.

## How to try a development build of Jest in another project

To link `jest` on the command line to `jest-cli/bin/jest.js` in a development
build:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/Jest_clone/packages/jest-cli
yarn link
```

To build Jest:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/Jest_clone

# Do one of the following:

# Check out a commit from another contributor, and then
yarn run build

# Or, save your changes to Jest, and then
yarn test # which also builds Jest
```

To run tests in another project with the development build of Jest:

```sh
cd /path/to/another/project
jest [options] # run jest-cli/bin/jest.js in the development build
```

* To decide whether to specify any options, see `test` under `scripts` in the
  `package.json` file of the other project.

To unlink `jest` on the command line from `jest-cli/bin/jest.js` in a
development build:

```sh
yarn unlink jest-cli
```

## Bugs

### Where to Find Known Issues

We will be using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on
this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before
filing a new issue, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. Please
provide a public repository with a runnable example.

### Security Bugs

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. With that in mind, please do not file public
issues; go through the process outlined on that page.

## How to Get in Touch

* Discord - [#jest](https://discord.gg/MWRhKCj) on
  [Reactiflux](http://www.reactiflux.com/)

## Code Conventions

* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
* 80 character line length strongly preferred.
* Prefer `'` over `"`.
* ES6 syntax when possible.
* Use [Flow types](http://flowtype.org/).
* Use semicolons;
